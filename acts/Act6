Act Six 


- shot of two men ("Johnson" and "Siegfried" from FE's army) are hiding; perched in an apartment building in an adjacent block from where the urban army is situated 
	- the men are loading hand guns 
	- a shot skips to them putting on cloths to make them look like a city worker and local businessman; they are preparing for stealth infiltration 
	- both men throw duffle bags over their shoulders and exit the room 

- a long (frontal, far away) shot of the men leaving the building, 
	- they are walking through the concrete and grass frontage, hide, behind some trees, then crossing a busy 2-lane street 
	- now a POV shot of the men looking down a by-way towards the buildings; ** the scene should be eerily quiet ** 
	- they bypass that easier route, and take a direct line to the side of a building; they hug the wall, walking along it in column formation  
	- approaching a driveway into the main block of the building complex, they take another straight line to a set of trees for cover 
	- they stop there and crouch to check their equipment, and nod confirmation to each other that they have the right location 
	(all communication between them is silent and visual) 
	- they both get up simultaneously, heads down, and begin to walk briskly across another lane-way to their target 
	
- almost reaching a big steel garbage bin in front of the building, they are fired upon by loud automatic fire 
	- they snap into action almost immediately, bolting to the garbage bin for cover 
	- they know they've been made and throw off any excess clothing, and peek around the corner to see where the fire is coming from 
	- more weapons fire rings out from the front of the building and one of the men lifts his gun abouve the bin and fires a few 
	return shots from his gun 
	- that same man pulls out an automatic rifle from his bag and loads it while giving instructions: 
	"I'll lay cover fire and you run to that side" 
	- they both count "3.2.1", then in unison, one lays automatic rifle fire abouve the bin while the other runs to cover behind the building 
	- now under cover, the other man pulls out his automatic rifle and loads it with fast military precision
	- they both count to three and lay down cover fire for the other man to pass to safety 

- armed men start pouring out of an opposite building and firing on the two 
- a van comes into the building from the road and blocks off an exit from their original direction 
- armed men from the UA star coming out of the van and firing on the two 

- the lead FE man now shouts that it's a setup; the UA has been waiting for the them; 
	- he barks some more instructions, then the crouched two get up, backs to each other a fire in opposite directions, 
	moving toward a parking area with cars for cover
	- behind some trees now, one breaks free and runs behind a car, while the other lays some cover fire
	- he now lays cover fire for his partner while he runs to his location 
- one of the men breaks the window of a car and hot wires it to start; they get in and run the car into the courtyard of an opposite 
building complex 
- they get out and run behind some garbage bins ... 




---- 
** walk stealthily to 3 block apartment complex 
** ambushed inside a labyrinthian structure ; tens of armed men from UA pour out of buildings and vans to pin them down (using garbage bins, cars, etc)
** they defend and escape by laying cover fire for each other and run using a staggered method to progress forward 
** they move to the inside of a building, quietly winding down hallways, playing cat and mouse with pursuers 
** walking upstairs they encounter enemy fire and fire fight continues 
** they make their way to the roof and radio for help; a silent black helicopter arrives to whisk them away 
** Urban Army (UA) is left behind as police sirens get closer; some vans escape and two main characters escape by parachuting from the roof of 
the building
