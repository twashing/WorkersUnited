Act Three 

- van pulls into a ranch ; past some initial trees and a small hill ; dusk is starting to set in; 
** we see the horizon and the curvature of the earth; the liquid sun dusking on the horizon ** 
	- make this subtly feel like some distant planet (a la Star Wars)
- MC exits the van and meets some other characters and the Project Manager 

** the MC and the Project Manager walk through a burnt out field with a blast crater in it ** 
- they arrive at a building , walk in and see engineers and construction workers busy crating equipment around 
- they go upstairs into another inner room to find a control centre; there are i) LCD computer screens on the wall 
ii) computers and tech, messily wired up together iii) multi-lingual chatter going on in the background iv) and desks 
with technicians and hackers 
** the context here is that there has just been a satellite launched and these guys are tracking and managing that satellite ** 

- the Project Manager (PM) asks MC, "Do you have the device"; MC gives it to PM
- PM shows MC the trajectory and status of the satellite ; he says that the next phase is ready

- later, there is a pagan festival with music in a darkening sky 
- there is a communal dinner, with stories being told 
- a conversation with an old lady telling of horrors she's endured. Used speech here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3JI-axaRF4 (http://maxkeiser.com/2010/12/11/greed-kills) 
** "Our family has been living in our region for more than 6 generations. The horror that these people bring upon us has been the most horrifying I or my family has ever seen. Children shot and killed. They bulldozed and destroyed water wells, our cattle, they are closing off the borders. We can't drink. Our livelihoods are destroyed and we are economically devastated. Tt's a systematic destruction of our ability survive. It is just hell.  

We try to keep our humanity. Right now we just try to protect the children. Sometimes the children know that life is different in other places; but we try to protect them... protect them from the horror.  Why this happens to us ?!?!" 

** MC says: "I know who did this. And I'm gonna get him" 

- woman weeps meekly and looks to the sky saying only a god (pick a nativist one) can save them 
- the camera has panned to the sky at this point and
