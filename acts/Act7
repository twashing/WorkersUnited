Act 7 

** FE and team are discussing situation and strategy 
	- Sir... 
	- "they were well armed and well prepared; had to be waiting for us" 
	- "think they were measuring our response time" 
	
	- FE flags his profile headers being used in financial grid; 12 possible locations, 
	including the federal reserve branch in Manhattan 

- MC is setting up hardware equipment in Manhattan for the main heist (a trap for FE) - computers and wiring to a network hub ;  they see that their activities have been noticed 
	-> FE begins making calls, tells his grid to go to 'red' status; instructs lieutenant to find 
	out what networks MC is using 
	
- MC & crew break into a building near federal reserve branch
	- they run down a hallway and see a more secure ring that has to be penetrated
	- they set up some more listening equipment & prepare to break into a door
	-> FE lieutenant's scan is about to reach the Federal Reserve building; he connects to the Fed's socket... 

- MC & crew set off a data bomb that freezes system control; an automatic system back-up is triggered, the data is being 
funneled to a back-up location
	-> lieutenant says that he's lost control of the scanned system - he's been frozen out 
	
	** FBI office gets an alert that there is a serious intrusion at the Federal Reserve Branch 
	** they easily track down the network source of the computer intrusion
	** they mobilize some officers and agents
	
	- MC's network equipment is siphoning off data that is coming down the pipe... 
	** camera has to see download progress while FE & co. are frantically trying to regain control 
	- MC's download is complete; they unfreeze system, quickly pack equipment and escape 

- lieutenant regains control of scanning computer systems ; he bewildered and quickly tries to determine what happened
- FE is caught off guard and goes to another, more private room and calls a CIA associate; "I need to speak with Brekker" 
	-> just then FBI cars peel up to front of FE's office building, get out of the car and race inside
- FE begins to explain what's happening with a brief background to the days events 
	-> the FBI breaks into his office, and begin searching for him 
- FE gets arrested
