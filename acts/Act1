Act One 

- camera pans over a low city scape 
- panning with collages of a city & park 
- camera pans are not made for humans, but being captured as a visual computer feed. rising throbbing of police sirens. then all 
goes silent 

- next scene is i) sun rays ii) penetrating squinted eyes iii) MC can hear his own breathing; iv) hearing is shot 
- MC moves silently and efficiently, then runs all out; internal quiet rises to a hard drum-tone (or the sound of a heartbeat). 
	- close by, yells start to filter into the sound scape coming from Swiss security professionals 

- the climax is the MC running/breaking through a window, to the outside. He falls 1 level, onto the top of a car. He squeals in 
pain & drops from the side of a car to the ground.
