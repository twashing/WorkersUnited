- camera pans down from sun, to a wide angle shot of the manhattan skyline 
- shot of a line of buildings just off central park , moves to Upper East Side 

- next shot hangs overhead the FE and wife, still asleep; facing apart from each other 
	- a soft, audible buzzer goes off and FE blinks and inhales with little animation 
- next few shots are short, 2 second shots 
	- left-of-frame has bathroom door open, shower running, with steam coming out ; maids are scurrying in right foreground, delivering trays of coffee, newspaper & breakfast 
	- FE sits on balcony while sipping coffee and reading paper; wife gives a quick, routine kiss on the cheek (wife is silent, subservient - very traditional) 
	- FE is buttoning up cuff links on dress shirt in front of mirror 
	- FE walks down spiral staircase to an awaiting chauffeur 
	( all of the activity has to circulate around FE - to serve his needs; the exciting parts of the scene is the luxury of his environment and exclusivity of his life ) 
- overhead shot of an Audi A8 going down a ritzy residential lane towards manhattan 
- FE looks out window to a more dense, commercial street scape (w/ a commercial building under construction) 
- left-side of frame has shot of Audi turning into a office tower; right-side, foreground has MC a few floors up, hiding behind some construction material (he's in commercial building under construction)
- MC is waiting for FE, with a directional antennal pointed at the Audi; he's collecting some information we see being read into a small laptop display 

- while FE's car pulls into underground parking garage, we see shots of MC on the move leaving his location 
- FE gets out of car and heads towards an elevator; MC arrives at a door and pulls out a magnetic card with a serial wire attached to the laptop; 
	- MC slips card into a reader and begins to type impatiently into his laptop. the door clicks open after a few seconds; the elevator arrives for the FE, he gets in and the doors close 
	- MC walks fast down a non-descript office hallway, 'round a corner and into a stairwell, up one level; fast shot of FE checking time on his watch 
	- MC walks into a server room, begins looking at server indexes trying to find a specific one. he finds it; now FE has arrived at his floor exits the elevator and begins to walk 
	through the entire floor of the office building (that he occupies). he nods a hello to a secretary 
	- MC is shown with wires hooked up from the server into his laptop. he is typing furiously now, reprogramming the server and downloading some data 
- as FE enters his office, his phone rings just as he sits down. he answers absently and is asked whether he just came from the server room some floors down. he says no; 
security guard on the other end says his card was used in a particular floor and location; FE replies that's impossible as he has his card on him; security guard says he will
check it out 
	- shot now, is of MC moving fast to shut his laptop, unfasten wires, and exit the room; shot of security guard gait down a hall while radioing the other guard about a 
	possible intrusion 
	- MC goes to a stair well, descends half a floor and begins to go out a window, onto the floor of a roof; -> a shot of a security guard on the outside of the building looking 
	around for any signs of an intruder 
	- MC sees and adjacent building, which is a far and dangerous jump; hi heart starts pounding as he prepares to make a running jump 
	- just then 2 guard converge on the same stair well and meet in the middle at the window; one reaches to open the window; they both step outside to Manhattan buildings 
	- they look around seeing no one there and go back inside
- next shot is now of security guard reentering his office and picking up the phone; he tells the FE that the area is clear and that they did not find any intruder 
- shot of FE's office, with a concerned look on his face; he acknowledges the security guards message; just as FE hangs up the phone, and lieutenant manager barges into the room and 
announces that there's been a data breach in their systems. 
- the lieutenant manager mentions that some header files on financial transaction data have been altered; some company profile data has also been stolen (identity)  
	- FE asks if it could be due to the business deal they are working on; lieutenant says that he cannot know that at this point 
	- FE states that "this deal is of primary importance to the organization. Nothing can jeopardize it." 
	- FE switches to a very brisk shorthand between the 2. something very militaristic 
	- FE tells lieutenant to setup a "..." (search protocol) using "..." (special equipment); prepare 2 "bo-peeps" to track down source of data breach
- lieutenant exits the office and goes to high tech, windowless command centre; he makes a call on a speaker phone and asks the other end to prepare
"Johnson" and "Siegfried" for 'deployment' 


-----
** what's been stolen - identity
** possibly due to the big business deal they have in play 
	- deal is very important and they have to find the source of the breach 
	(response to breach and shorthand between the 2 is very militaristic)
	(FE tells lieutenant to prepare 2 "bo-peeps" (special equipment) to track down source of data breach)
** lieutenant goes to command centre to begin 
-----
= communicate to the audience some very sophisticated data systems 
= communicate that they a military-like command and control (incl. banter) within organization 
= communicate to the audience that this is a major deal that is happening, 
	- right before the breach, FE says "this deal is of primary importance to the organization. Nothing can jeopardize it."
----- 
= they need to find the source of the data breach 
= they wonder if the breach has anything to do with the deal they're working on at the moment
