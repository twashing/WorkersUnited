Act 9 

- FE leaves FBI ; realises that he doesn't know who opponent is - state or non-state? connected to oil deal? 
- next move is to find out who opponent is; 
	- he goes to a hideout in an apartment building ; tells team where he is going 

- SpI has taken over investigation and links Switzerl. & NY heists as same group 
	- discusses connections and possibilities with assitantant and FBI

- FE gets to apartment and makes a secret channel phone call to a highly connected individual (SpI, but they never meet) 
	- finds out about Swiss bank theft 
	- heist profiles are very similar, thus the same person 
	- this person knows a lot about FE; probably a former employee 
	- but FE's unit only has a few retired soldiers... and a few dead ones. 
- FE knows his protocols (his playboook) are known to his opponent 
- he makes sends a secret signal (from phone) to disburse, and make evasive manuevers 

- next shot is MC staking out FE from an apartment across the street 
- FE is not making any movements in the apartment; MC starts to get suspicious, checks his watch  
- next he sees FE briskly leaving out of the front of the apartment doors 
	- MC suspects something is up; he moves to the door of his room and opens it slowly with gun in one hand 
	- he fakes stepping out and just misses a hail of gun fire door
	- MC throws a smoke bomb out into the hallway
	- shooter (sentry - Johnson) cannot see through smoke; moves in with gun at ready 
	- walks into room and doesn't see MC 
	** begins to walk out and is ambushed by MC; removes his weapon and big fight scene occurs

( "Zbigniew Brzezinski" "The Grand Chessboard" )

- MC: the fall of the Soviet Union was the final step for the United States becoming the first truly global superpower 
- FE: and the chief political prize is Eurasia and its energy resources. we're talking about American primacy and its geostrategic imperatives. how we 'manage' that region is imperative 
- MC: so you murdered..

MC lists charges... 
...

FE's speech... 

- Without sustained and directed American involvement, the forces of global disorder will come to dominate the world scene. This geopolitical fragmentation is already happening around the world.
