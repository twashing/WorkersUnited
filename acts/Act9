Act 9 

- FE leaves FBI ; realises that he doesn't know who opponent is - state or non-state? connected to oil deal? 
- next move is to find out who opponent is; 
	- he goes to a hideout in an apartment building ; tells team where he is going 

- SpI has taken over investigation and links Switzerl. & NY heists as same group 
	- discusses connections and possibilities with assitantant and FBI

- FE gets to apartment and makes a secret channel phone call to a highly connected individual (SpI, but they never meet) 
	- finds out about Swiss bank theft; FE says "why wasn't I notified", SpI says that BIS needed to keep it secret to maintain confidence 
	- heist profiles are very similar, thus the same person 
	- this person knows a lot about FE; probably a former employee 
	- but FE's unit only has a few retired soldiers... and a few dead ones. 
- FE knows his protocols (his playboook) are known to his opponent 
- he makes sends a secret signal (from phone) to disburse, and make evasive manuevers 

- next shot is MC staking out FE from an apartment across the street 
- FE is not making any movements in the apartment; MC starts to get suspicious, checks his watch  
- next he sees FE briskly leaving out of the front of the apartment doors 
	- MC suspects something is up; he moves to the door of his room and opens it slowly with gun in one hand 
	- he fakes stepping out and just misses a hail of gun fire door
	- MC throws a smoke bomb out into the hallway
	- shooter (sentry - Johnson) cannot see through smoke; moves in with gun at ready 
	- walks into room and doesn't see MC 
	** begins to walk out and is ambushed by MC; removes his weapon and big fight scene occurs 
		- MC sets another smoke bomb in an adjoining room, ambushing him a 2nd time by shooting him 

- the second sentry and FE meet up in a crowded space; they begin to retreat sptrategically, trying to shield themselves within alleys, bridges 
- they take an SUV; they enter a tunnel and are tensely scanning for any danger; as they exit the tunnel and approach a fork in the road, they are ambushed with gunfire, forcing them down a specific road; they are being forced back to FE's home 
- they arrive and the FE separates from the other sentry and goes to his room
	** there, the FE is ambushed by the MC and the FINAL SCENE ensues 

---- 
FINAL SCENE 

( "Zbigniew Brzezinski" "The Grand Chessboard" )

- MC: the fall of the Soviet Union was the final step for the United States becoming the first truly global superpower 
- FE: and the chief political prize is Eurasia and its energy resources. we're talking about American primacy and its geostrategic imperatives. how we 'manage' that region is imperative 
- MC: so you murdered..

MC lists charges... 
...

FE's speech... 

- Without sustained and directed American involvement, the forces of global disorder will come to dominate the world scene. This geopolitical fragmentation is already happening around the world. 

... tells MC that he does not understand the implications of the theft or his current actions 

** at the end, the MC exits with a partner that has taken care of the other sentry 


---- 
... deal with SpI investig. 
... starts setting up for the final transaction for the oil deal 
... FE says "We need to improve out induction process. Break down recruits better. You don't understand... " 

-> more reference to satellite 
-> more scenes of power for FE
