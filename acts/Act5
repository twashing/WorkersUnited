Act Five 


- MC arrives at a run down row house in the Bronx 
- an old man (OM) answers the door; his face should immediately tell a story of life at street level; strong, 
but weary; a southern frankness, but living in the north 
- the OM looks the MC from head to toe; MC is stone faced, letting himself be evaluated 
- the OM furrows his brow as he looks at the morning sun rays; "We're on a schedule" he states 
- shot of pitch black, with the sun coming through small garage door windows, then the silhouette of a garage door opening; 
the outline of car appearing 

- car drives through various Bronx neighbourhoods; streets are stark and run down (music is 60s soul with a slow tempo) 
- they approach a bridge as the OM begins to situate them: "Leavin' the Bronx... " 
	- dashboard shot of car going over the bridge, with an imposing jumble of highrises in a light haze; the Manhatten skyline in the far distance: 
	"now we comin into Haaarlem" 

- they visit a safe house in Harlem 
	- this is where the second heist is being set up and there have to be hints to that allude to some preparations 
	
- they go to a 3 block neighbourhood complex in Queens 
	- this is where he meets the Philosopher (Ph), an experienced revolutionary who is not too deluded by ideals, but is willing to fight for 
	human freedom 
	
	- MC discusses the next move in this operation with Ph; they start to float abouve tactics and review their strategy based on the existing
	banking and security architecture & how governments fit into and act within that framework. Ph has to have a piercing insight into these 
	inner workings 

... concept of credit / money as debt ; mechanics of money creation ( ... ) 
... government cooperation (fiat / legal tender, laws, debt enforcement) 
... Who are the puppet masters? Inverting mechanism of control 

	- mention that FE should be tracing their signal soon... 
	
- Ph gets a call on a phone that lookouts have spotted 2 sentries (special forces guys), casing the buildings 
	- shot of special force agents are camped in a residential building with line of sight to the 3 block neighbourhood 
	- MC is told that prep work is done and to leave immediately... setup is ready for the next target
