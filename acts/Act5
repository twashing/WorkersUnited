Act Five 


- MC arrives at a run down row house in the Bronx 
- an old man (OM) answers the door; his face should immediately tell a story of life at street level; strong, but weary; a southern frankness, but living in the north 
- the OM looks the MC from head to toe; MC is stone faced, letting himself be evaluated 
- the OM furrows his brow as he looks at the morning sun rays; "We're on a schedule" he states 
- shot of pitch black, with the sun coming through small garage door windows, then the silhouette of a garage door opening; 
the outline of car appearing 

- car drives through various Bronx neighbourhoods; streets are stark and run down (music is 60s soul with a slow tempo) 
- they approach a bridge as the OM begins to situate them: "Leavin' the Bronx... " 
	- dashboard shot of car going over the bridge, with an imposing jumble of highrises in a light haze; the Manhatten skyline in the far distance: 
	"now we comin into Haaarlem" 

- they visit a safe house in Harlem 
	- this is where the second heist is being set up and there have to be hints to that allude to some preparations 

- they go to a 3 block neighbourhood complex in Queens 
	- first shot is of the OM letting MC out of the car; MC walks into a large courtyard with parents and children playing 
	- Ph appears out of a high window of one of the buildings; he shouts a "hello" geeting to the MC and waves him upstairs 

- next scene is in a room with MC entering through the door; the Ph is waiting there for him; 
- this is where he meets the Philosopher (Ph), an experienced revolutionary who is not too deluded by ideals, but is willing to fight for human freedom 

- we see MC loosening up a bit as he is visibly happy to see Ph ; but he's still hurried "We don't have much time"; 
- Ph counters "time is what you make of it"
- MC: "sometimes, even when I'm silent, I can hear that loud ringing in my ear. it's from all the chaos in my life. sometimes just a minute of that silence can feel like a lifetime. if there's one thing I've realised, it's the time I've lost. and we don't have a lot of it left." 

- Ph looks out the window, seeing people go by and children play, and comments on life: 
"I'm constantly amazed by just looking outside and seeing this sea of people. at each individual life, their dreams, their expectations, inspirations, insights, intention, imagination, free will, creativity, understanding, purpose." Ph stops to pull in air 

- "it's a bounty of beauty", the Ph remarks, pleased with the nugget of happiness he's just carved. MC surrenders a chuckle and a smile. 
- Ph continues "who am I? what are we? what IS time? does time belong to us? Is it our own? We DON'T have much of own own time... Can we change that?" 
- MC leans back for a moment, tired and weary. "I'm not sure how much will change even if we succeed" 


(Death of the liberal class ; based on talks / polemics of Chris Hedges) Ph begins to speak... 
- You know, in Italy after WWI, Mussolini used his "Blackshirts" to suppress their opponents in the working class 
- we're seeing something similar, where the banking class now, is eviscerating most people outside of the top 2%; an oligarchy uses a debt-based credit system that none of us sanction or have control over, to create this neo-feudal system with a permanent underclass 
- they've  leveraged credit to invert culture itself 

- our society has changed the way we communicate information: we've gone from the written form to an image-based, emotionally, commercially, for-profit driven system of ideas ... truth is dead 
- culture has been commercialized - made a commodity. Our cultural and individual values are now determined by the market;  we speak in the rhetoric of liberal values, but what liberals do and the alliances they make have made them collaborators of war and fascism 
- the ruthless programmes implemented by FE..(he pauses to shake his head) it's just rapacious greed, even while preserving his facade, a voice of humanity and progress; he's an alien to his rhetoric 

- we're in a season of discontent 
- we need to take back control of our lives; a way to directly invert the mechanism of control 

- Dostoevsky watched a similar breakdown of the liberal class in "Notes from the underground" 
- So what is resistance? what response should we give to this ... attack ; we cannot say nothing; we cannot do nothing. 


- MC mentions that FE should be tracing their signal soon... 
- Ph gets a call on a phone that lookouts have spotted 2 sentries (special forces guys), casing the buildings) 
	- shot of special force agents are camped in a residential building with line of sight to the 3 block neighbourhood 
	- MC is told that prep work is done and to leave immediately... setup is ready for the next target 


---- 

... concept of credit / money as debt ; mechanics of money creation ( ... ) 
... government cooperation (fiat / legal tender, laws, debt enforcement) 
... Who are the puppet masters? Inverting mechanism of control
