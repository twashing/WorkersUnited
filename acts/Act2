Act Two 


- MC exits a main train station, and gets in a car 


... next few shots are fast montage shots 
- MC is driving on a busy (4-lane) freeway 
- then he's driving on a more remote (2-lane) country highway 
- he pulls into a gas station / truck stop 


... here, the camera starts to slow down 
- he exits a car, walks to a big windowless van and knocks on the door; the door slides open and a gun points out , with the holder 
asking the MC to ID himself. 
	- MC says "erschliessen" (German of "to decipher"), and is let into the van 
- van has 4 other migrant workers; van leaves gas station and begins driving south 


... next set of shots are the swiss authorities discussing what was stolen (all in German) 
- as shot of van pulling away, a voice is layered on top... "What was stolen" 
- next shot is in a modern, well designed office suite. office walls are glass; lights are bright with a minimalist design; conference table and chairs are very contemporary; 3 men are in a meeting at the conference table. One man, the boss, sits alone on one end, while the other two sit opposite to him. One looks nervous, while the other resolutely begins to explain the situation: 
	- "sir, a major communication device has gone missing. this is equipment that facilitates interbank credit operations" 
	- the boss prods, "explain"... 

-> the van has to pass through i) Swiss landscape 
	- "sir, the bank of international settlements is located here in Basel. it's basically a bank for central banks"; boss counters "yes, I know it" 

-> van passes through ii) southern French landscape iii) Spanish highways 
	- "the BIS helps set policy and resolve payments between central banks with its systems. computer infrastructure used in that communication was stolen. sir, these people can conceivably connect to global credit flows, tamper money supply; it's very serious" 

-> ; van taking a ferry between Spain and Morocco 
	- "have we identified the people so far?; So far, we only know that there's one person. he is a professional with knowledge of financial instruments and infrastructure" 
	- "who is he; we don't know"
	- boss responds with some action items: "I will contact the Director immediately. We need to set up a conference call with Brussels and Washington... " 

-> iv) some profile shots of van driving by the Moroccan countryside, w/ farmers in the background v) maybe 1 desert shot, then a vi) sub-saharan shot 
	"... this incident has global reach" 

** the van then arrives at it's destination in a remote ranch complex 
	- it's late afternoon & the sky is still bright, but w/ colour; soldiers manning the gate
